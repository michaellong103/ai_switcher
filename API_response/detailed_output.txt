[96mMK-7684A With or Without Other Anticancer Therapies in Participants With Selected Solid Tumors (MK-7684A-005) (KEYVIBE-005)[0m
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of pembrolizumab/vibostolimab co-formulation (MK-7684A) with or without other anticancer therapies in participants with selected advanced solid tumors. The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab/vibostolimab co-formulation is superior to pembrolizumab alone in terms of objective response rate or progression-free survival in participants with cervical cancer.
