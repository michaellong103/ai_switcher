        "briefSummary": "T Cell Receptor-engineered T-cell therapy (TCR T-cell therapy) offers a potentially transformative approach to treating cancer, but is currently limited by the lack of known targets (Maus and June, 2016; Ping et al., 2018). Arguably the most clinically meaningful way to discover new targets and TCRs for TCR T-cell therapy is to study the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of patients that are actively responding to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. These T cells are clonally expanded as a result of checkpoint inhibition and are responsible for the patient's clinical response. The goal of this study is to acquire tumor and blood samples from up to 200 patients with solid tumor malignancies who respond to ICI therapy. T cells will be isolated from these samples and the targets of their TCRs determined using TScan's genome-wide, high-throughput target ID technology. The expected outcome of this study is the discovery of a collection of new targets for TCR T-cell therapy, along with associated TCRs that will then be developed as novel therapies for patients with similar malignancies."

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as balstilimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ivermectin may help block the formation of growths that may become cancer. Giving ivermectin with balstilimab may increase the effect of balstilimab in shrinking tumors in patients with triple negative breast cancer. The secondary objectives of the study include evaluating the following efficacy outcomes: objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and patients' quality of life (QOL) by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30)."

Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Shorter treatment without anthracycline chemotherapy may work the same as the usual anthracycline chemotherapy treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer."

        "briefSummary": "This study compares the experiences of people who receive information about genetic testing from a computer-generated character to patients who receive information from a human genetics healthcare provider. Patients with cancer are increasingly recommended for genetic testing as standard of care. Multiple factors contribute to low usage of genetic testing but for many patients the lack of access to genetic counseling and testing is an important and flexible factor. Lack of access is especially relevant to racial/ethnic minority patients and those living in non-metropolitan rural settings who are frequently cared for at safety-net hospitals with limited genetics services. Alternative delivery models are necessary to improve rates of access to genetic testing in patients with cancer. Health information technology is under used by genetics providers. A patient-facing relational agent (PERLA) will provide pre-test genetics education in both English and Spanish across two clinical settings to facilitate more timely access to genetic testing. Using the PERLA intervention may help researchers learn different ways to provide education about genetic testing to patients with cancer compared to usual care."

        "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of anti-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes (A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1 overexpression positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed/recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory), and that may have spread from where it first started (primary site) to nearby tissue, lymph nodes (advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). NY-ESO-1 is an antigen found on the surface of many different types of tumor cells including TNBC. Antigens make it possible for immune cells to recognize and kill germ cells that invade the body, however, it is more difficult for immune cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. T cells are a special type of immune cell in the blood. These T cells may be trained to recognize the NY-ESO-1 antigen on tumor cells, allowing the T cells to attack and kill those tumor cells. The A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells are T cells that have been removed from the patient's blood through a process called leukapheresis and then changed in the laboratory to recognize NY-ESO-1 on tumor cells. When given back to the patient, these A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells find and attack tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. They are given before the T cells to support optimum activity of the A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. IL-2 (aldesleukin) is in a class of drugs known as cytokines. It is a man-made version of a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the body to produce other chemicals which increase the body's ability to fight cancer. A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells may kill more tumor cells in patients with recurrent or refractory advanced or metastatic TNBC that overexpresses NY-ESO-1."
