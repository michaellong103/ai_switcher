        "briefTitle": "Implementation and Evaluation of a Rare Disease Algorithm to Identify Persons at Risk of Gaucher Disease Using Data From Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the United States (Project Searchlight)",
        "briefSummary": "This is a three-phase study comprising both retrospective and prospective components, as follows:\n\nPhase I: Deployment of Rare Disease Algorithm:\n\nA diagnostic screening algorithm was developed using advanced analytical methods to identify patients who have an increased likelihood of having Gaucher disease. This tool will be applied to a health system's electronic health records (EHR).\n\nThe top 50 active patients per healthcare system will be identified as \"highly ranked by the RDA\" and moved to Phase II. As three to four healthcare systems are expected to participate in this study, between 150 to 200 persons are expected to be identified and included in Phase II.\n\nPhase II: Retrospective review of medical records of highly ranked persons: The listing of persons highly-ranked by the RDA from phase I will be forwarded to the study team within each participating healthcare system. After reviewing the RDA reports and medical records of each highly ranked person, study site personnel will determine eligibility for Phase III based on the relevant selection criteria listed in the section below.\n\nPhase III: Prospective diagnostic testing: Eligible persons (or their parent/guardian) from Phase II will be contacted and asked to provide consent for inclusion into the study. After consent is received, blood samples will be collected and sent for Gaucher diagnostic testing. Because of overlap in clinical symptoms between Gaucher disease and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), patients will also receive diagnostic testing for ASMD. Results will be shared with study site personnel, who will subsequently inform the study subject (and/or their parent/guardian, where appropriate) of results. It is anticipated that participation of a typical subject will be less than 3 months."

        "briefTitle": "International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Disease Registry & Pregnancy Sub-registry",
        "briefSummary": "The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an ongoing, international multi-center, strictly observational program that tracks the routine clinical outcomes for patients with Gaucher disease, irrespective of treatment status. No experimental intervention is involved; patients in the Registry undergo clinical assessments and receive care as determined by the patient's treating physician.\n\nThe objectives of the Registry are:\n\n* To enhance understanding of the variability, progression, identification, and natural history of Gaucher disease, with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic intervention.\n* To assist the Gaucher medical community with the development of recommendations for monitoring patients, and to provide reports on patient outcomes, to optimize patient care.\n* To characterize the Gaucher disease population.\n* To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of imiglucerase and of eliglustat.\n\nGaucher Pregnancy Sub-registry: The primary objective of this Sub-registry is to track pregnancy outcomes, including complications and infant growth, in all women with Gaucher disease during pregnancy, regardless of whether they receive disease-specific therapy. No experimental intervention is given; thus a patient will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard of care treatment as determined by the patient's physician.If a patient consents to this Sub-registry, information about the patient's medical and obstetric history, pregnancy, and birth will be collected, and, if a patient consents to data collection for her infant, data on infant growth through month 36 postpartum will be collected."

        "briefSummary": "The New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) Research Institute is performing this research to accelerate Parkinson's disease research and drug development by using cells from the body (such as skin or blood cells) to make stem cells and other types of cells, conduct research on the samples, perform genetic testing, and/or store the samples for future use.\n\nThrough this research, researchers hope to identify future treatments or even cures for Parkinson's disease."

        "briefSummary": "Study J3Z-MC-OJAA is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, open-label, ascending dose, first in-human study that will evaluate the safety of intracisternal LY3884961 administration in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease with at least 1 pathogenic GBA1 mutation. Two dose level cohorts of LY3884961 are planned (Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2). The duration of the study is 5 years. During the first year, patients will be evaluated for the effect of LY3884961 on safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and clinical efficacy measures. Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 4 years to continue to monitor safety as well as selected biomarker and efficacy measures."
