        "briefSummary": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents about 15% of breast cancers and is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 non-amplification. Women with TNBC tend to be younger, African American, and BRCA-1 germline carriers. The hallmark of this subtype is early metastatic recurrences with a peak frequency 1-2 years. Prognosis for metastatic TNBC is especially poor with median survival of about 1 year as compared to about 2-4 years with other types of metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThe primary objective of the phase I part of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of leflunomide in women with previously treated TNBC (or ER+ , HER2-neg MBC in Phase I). The primary objective of the phase 2 part of this study is to determine the efficacy of leflunomide in patients with TNBC.\n\nLeflunomide, which will be taken daily by mouth, is an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). This proposal will test if DHODH is a novel target for a particular subset of women with metastatic TNBC."

        "briefSummary": "T Cell Receptor-engineered T-cell therapy (TCR T-cell therapy) offers a potentially transformative approach to treating cancer, but is currently limited by the lack of known targets (Maus and June, 2016; Ping et al., 2018). Arguably the most clinically meaningful way to discover new targets and TCRs for TCR T-cell therapy is to study the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of patients that are actively responding to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. These T cells are clonally expanded as a result of checkpoint inhibition and are responsible for the patient's clinical response. The goal of this study is to acquire tumor and blood samples from up to 200 patients with solid tumor malignancies who respond to ICI therapy. T cells will be isolated from these samples and the targets of their TCRs determined using TScan's genome-wide, high-throughput target ID technology. The expected outcome of this study is the discovery of a collection of new targets for TCR T-cell therapy, along with associated TCRs that will then be developed as novel therapies for patients with similar malignancies."

Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen vaccine will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer."

        "briefSummary": "This study will test any good and bad effects of combining the study drugs pembrolizumab and olaparib, given before the standard surgical procedure, to treat TNBC or HR+ HER2- breast cancers. The study drugs could shrink cancer, but they could also cause side effects. The study researchers want to find out whether the study drugs will shrink the cancer by a certain percentage compared with its current size, which may improve the outcome of surgery."

        "briefTitle": "A Study of SDX-7320 in Combination With Eribulin for People With Breast Cancer",
        "briefSummary": "The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the study drug, SDX-7320, when combined with the standard chemotherapy eribulin, is an effective treatment for people with TNBC and metabolic dysfunction. The researchers will also look at whether the study treatment (SDX-7320 combined with eribulin) is safe and causes few or mild side effects in participants. The researchers will compare this treatment approach to eribulin alone."

        "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of LYL797, a ROR1-targeted CAR T-cell therapy, in patients with ROR1+ relapsed or refractory triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The first part of the study will determine the safe dose for the next part of the study, and will enroll TNBC and NSCLC patients. The second part of the study will test that dose in additional TNBC and NSCLC patients."

        "briefSummary": "The goal of the project is to identify a molecular signature of tumor stroma from \"normal\" adjacent breast tissue obtained prospectively at the time of breast conserving surgery before and after receiving intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in subjects that have luminal A and triple negative breast cancer. IORT is considered as being standard of care."

        "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to find out if the experimental product, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) in combination with pembrolizumab given after surgery, is effective and safe compared to the treatment of physician's choice (TPC) which includes either pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus capecitabine in participants with triple negative breast cancer that still remains after surgery and pre-surgical treatment."
