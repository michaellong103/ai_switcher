        "briefTitle": "International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Disease Registry & Pregnancy Sub-registry",
        "briefSummary": "The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an ongoing, international multi-center, strictly observational program that tracks the routine clinical outcomes for patients with Gaucher disease, irrespective of treatment status. No experimental intervention is involved; patients in the Registry undergo clinical assessments and receive care as determined by the patient's treating physician.\n\nThe objectives of the Registry are:\n\n* To enhance understanding of the variability, progression, identification, and natural history of Gaucher disease, with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic intervention.\n* To assist the Gaucher medical community with the development of recommendations for monitoring patients, and to provide reports on patient outcomes, to optimize patient care.\n* To characterize the Gaucher disease population.\n* To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of imiglucerase and of eliglustat.\n\nGaucher Pregnancy Sub-registry: The primary objective of this Sub-registry is to track pregnancy outcomes, including complications and infant growth, in all women with Gaucher disease during pregnancy, regardless of whether they receive disease-specific therapy. No experimental intervention is given; thus a patient will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard of care treatment as determined by the patient's physician.If a patient consents to this Sub-registry, information about the patient's medical and obstetric history, pregnancy, and birth will be collected, and, if a patient consents to data collection for her infant, data on infant growth through month 36 postpartum will be collected."
