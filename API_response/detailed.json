        "briefTitle": "TrialNet Pathway to Prevention of T1D",
        "briefSummary": "Rationale:\n\nThe accrual of data from the laboratory and from epidemiologic and prevention trials has improved the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Genetic and immunologic factors play a key role in the development of T1DM, and characterization of the early metabolic abnormalities in T1DM is steadily increasing. However, information regarding the natural history of T1DM remains incomplete. The TrialNet Natural History Study of the Development of T1DM (Pathway to Prevention Study) has been designed to clarify this picture, and in so doing, will contribute to the development and implementation of studies aimed at prevention of and early treatment in T1DM.\n\nPurpose:\n\nTrialNet is an international network dedicated to the study, prevention, and early treatment of type 1 diabetes. TrialNet sites are located throughout the United States, Canada, Finland, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand. TrialNet is dedicated to testing new approaches to the prevention of and early intervention for type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe goal of the TrialNet Natural History Study of the Development of Type 1 Diabetes is to enhance our understanding of the demographic, immunologic, and metabolic characteristics of individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Natural History Study will screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to identify those at risk for developing the disease. Relatives of people with type 1 diabetes have about a 5% percent chance of being positive for the antibodies associated with diabetes. TrialNet will identify adults and children at risk for developing diabetes by testing for the presence of these antibodies in the blood. A positive antibody test is an early indication that damage to insulin-secreting cells may have begun. If this test is positive, additional testing will be offered to determine the likelihood that a person may develop diabetes. Individuals with antibodies will be offered the opportunity for further testing to determine their risk of developing diabetes over the next 5 years and to receive close monitoring for the development of diabetes."

        "briefSummary": "The study is a two-arm, multicenter, double-blinded clinical trial testing sequential therapy with rituximab-pvvr followed by abatacept versus rituximab-pvvr alone in new onset T1D. The primary objective is to test whether the C-peptide response to a 2-hour mixed meal tolerance test, will be improved in participants with new onset T1D who are treated with Abatacept after Rituximab-pvvr compared to those treated with Rituximab-pvvr and placebo 24 months after enrollment."

A diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes will be studied. The study population will have a large range for duration of diabetes and glycemic control, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). They will be enrolled in the study regardless of their prior diabetes regimen, including using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI), Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) or Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy (SAP)"

The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does it reduce stress on the cells that make insulin?\n* Does it preserve what is left of the body's insulin production? Participants will take either DFMO or a placebo (looks like DFMO but has no active ingredients) two times a day for about 6 months. Participants will have 6 in person visits and 1 phone visit over a period of 12 months. Visits will include blood draws urine collection and other tests."

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the Fractyl DMR Procedure using the Revita\u00ae System compared to a sham. Subjects randomized to the DMR procedure will be followed per protocol till 48 weeks post treatment. Subjects in the Sham treatment arm will be offered cross over to receive the DMR treatment at 48 weeks and will be followed per protocol for 48 weeks post treatment."

Thus, the results of the DREAM-ON study could inform future clinical practice guidelines for the management AP as well as potentially extending the licensing authorization for CGM to include use in patients with pancreatogenic (Type 3c) DM."
