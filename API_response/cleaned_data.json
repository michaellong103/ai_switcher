The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n    * Women \\< 50 years of age are considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n    * Women \u2265 50 years of age are considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n12. TIL score \\> 1%.",
        "ExclusionCriteria": "1. Bilateral breast cancer.\n2. Prior malignancies that require ongoing active therapy or are at clinically significant risk of systemic recurrence in the opinion of the investigator.\n3. Suspicion for, or histologically confirmed metastatic disease.\n4. Symptomatic primary tumor.\n5. Primary tumor with potential for skin ulceration or invasion of the chest wall, or with pain that would suggest rapid progression or imminent muscle/skin involvement in the opinion of the enrolling investigator.\n6. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or antiPDL2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX40, CD137). Patients who have received these agents more than 3 years prior for other malignancies may be considered if they are not still at clinically significant risk of systemic recurrence in the opinion of the investigator.\n7. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n8. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in excess of prednisone 10mg daily or equivalent in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n10. Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n\n    Additionally, COVID-19 vaccinations (including boosters) should not be scheduled within 72 hours (before or after) of dosing days for INBRX-106 and pembrolizumab.\n11. Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n12. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n13. Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n14. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n15. History of allogenic tissue/solid organ transplantation.\n16. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Has a known additional malignancy (other than their current breast cancer diagnosis) that is progressing or has required active systemic treatment within the past 3 years.\n\n    Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n17. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n18. Active infection requiring systemic therapy with the exception of UTI requiring oral antibiotic therapy and prophylactic anti-viral therapy (e.g. Acyclovir).\n19. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.\n20. Known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. Patients with naturally acquired immunity are allowed (i.e. HBsAg(-); HBcAb(+); HBsAb(+/-). Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n21. Any known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).",
