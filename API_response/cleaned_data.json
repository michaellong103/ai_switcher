For this reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and through 180 days after completion of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab.

Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids or local steroid injections (e.g. intra-articular injection)\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan premedication).\n* Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to vaccines, such as anaphylaxis, hives or respiratory difficulty.\n* Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\>= 470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) (within 15 minutes at 5 minutes apart).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, evidence of any acute or chronic viral illness or disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
